				<p>Want to get in touch with Josh? I promise that I read every message,
					but I can’t promise to respond to them.</p>
				<p>However, before you write, please read the FAQ (below) and see if your question might already have an
					answer. If not, my email address is at the bottom of the page. BAM!</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>I found a typo in one of your books...</b></li>
					<p>Feel free to let me know! However, first check the <a href="typos.html">Book Typos.</a></p>

					<li><b>Can you recommend a good book for learning statistics?</b></li>
					<p>Yes! The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Statistics (available Spring, 2026).</p>

					<li><b>Can you recommend a good book about machine learning?</b></li>
					<p>Yes! <a href="./statquest-store/">The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning</a>.</p>

					<li><b>Can you recommend a good book about neural networks and AI?</b></li>
					<p>Yes! <a href="./statquest-store/">The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Neural Networks and AI</a>.
					</p>

					<li><b>What’s the best way to go through your videos?</b></li>
					<p>All of my videos are organized by topic, from basic to advanced, on my <a
							href="video_index.html">Videos</a> page. So, just pick a topic you’re interested and dive
						in.</p>

					<li><b>Can I work for you?</b></li>
					<p>Unfortunately I don't have any openings at this time.</p>

					<li><b>Can you do a StatQuest on <b>[</b> insert great idea for a StatQuest here <b>]</b> ?</b></li>
					<p>Maybe. I get about 2 or 3 requests every day, but can only create, at most, 2 videos a month.
						This means my “to-do” list is huge and growing at an alarming rate; much faster than it is
						shrinking. Priority goes to subjects that a lot of people ask for. If you send me a request,
						know that I will read it and assign priority based on it, but I probably won’t write back.</p>

					<li><b>Can you send me a StatQuest as a PDF?</b></li>
					<p>Yes! You can purchase <a href="./statquest-store/">StatQuest Study Guides</a>. These contain all
						the essential bits from the videos, but condensed into a few pages that are easy to review
						before exams and job interviews. Plus, by purchasing a study guide, you will help make it
						possible for me to continue making StatQuest content! <b>DOUBLE BAM!!</b></p>

					<li><b>How do I cite StatQuest?</b></li>
					<p>You can cite StatQuest the same way you would cite any other website or YouTube video. Here is an
						example:</p>
					<blockquote>StatQuest. “R-squared explained” YouTube, Joshua Starmer, 3 Feb. 2015,
						https://youtu.be/2AQKmw14mHM.</blockquote>

					<li><b>Can you answer my question about <b>[</b> insert burning topic here <b>]</b> ?</b></li>
					<p>When people have questions about something, I generally prefer that they post the question as a
						comment on a StatQuest Video. That way, when I answer, everyone can benefit from it.</p>
					<p>If you have a question about something not covered in a StatQuest, feel free to send it to me. I
						may answer, but don’t be offended if I do not.</p>
					<li><b>I’m writing an article about statistics/machine learning, can I use screen shots from your
							videos?</b></li>
					<p>To be honest, I would rather you not use screenshots. Instead, I would rather you post the video.
						One reason for this is that if you use screenshots, then you will, most likely, also have to
						follow my examples. My examples are fine, but I rarely, if ever, discuss examples from the world
						of finance, engineering, library science, or whatever your specialty field is. By not using
						screenshots, you’ll have an opportunity to create a new example that the world has never seen
						before and will help people in new ways that my video cannot. So please think of your
						presentation as an opportunity to bring something new and useful into the world.</p>
